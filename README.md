# Webgeplapper Episoden (WIP)

This repository contains all of webgeplappers episode-metadata.

Since we don't want to spam Github with many large files, I do not commit the
actual soundfiles.

## Stop! Hammertime! Each and everything is still just an idea!!1!!elf!!

This and all other repositories are not really productive at this point. I'm just
exploring how I could create a dev-podcast-friendly publishing tool.

In no way I am intending to obsolete other publishing-tools or platforms. In the
end this is more like a Jekyll for podcasts, then an allround-solution like the
Podlove Publisher. The idea is shamelessly ~~stolen~~ inspired by the guys of
Bin√§rgewitter.

That said, I'm still aiming for some things that might not be present anywhere else
yet (at least that I'm aware):

 - More or less all meta-information the Podlove Publisher is able to save, is
 represented here too
 - Everything we declare is declared in a way that it could be used for both:
 video and audio podcasts
 - We really don't care about whether or not the podcaster wishes to use smth
 besides this. If he wants to upload his stuff on youtube/soundcloud, we are
 fine with that too.
 - [Nearly] all settings are optional.
 - Shownotes will be in a format as close to the OpenShownotesFormat as
 possible. If we need something more, we will try to do it via a new `#marker`.
 - Chaptermarks are oriented at the stuff Podlove Publisher and Ultrashall uses.
